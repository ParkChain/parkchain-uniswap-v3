# Introduction

The KoinParkSwap V3 smart contract is an updated version of the decentralized exchange protocol built on the Park Chain blockchain. It introduces various enhancements and features compared to the previous versions. Here is a high-level overview of the flow of the KoinParkSwap V3 smart contract.

# Contract_Deployment

The KoinParkSwap V3 smart contract is deployed to the Park Chain network using a deployment mechanism like Truffle or Remix. Upon deployment, it is assigned a unique address on the blockchain.

# Concentrated-Liquidity-Positions

KoinParkSwap V3 introduces the concept of concentrated liquidity positions. Liquidity providers can create positions with specific price ranges, known as liquidity ranges, for a pair of ERC20 tokens. This allows providers to concentrate their liquidity at desired price levels.

# Liquidity-Provision

Liquidity providers can deposit tokens into specific liquidity positions by calling the create or increaseLiquidity functions of the KoinParkSwap V3 contract. They specify the token amounts, the price range for the position, and other relevant parameters.

# Token-Swapping

Users can swap tokens within the specified price ranges by calling the swap function of the KoinParkSwap V3 contract. They provide input details such as the input token, output token, desired amount, and the target price range. The contract executes the swap based on the available liquidity within the specified price range.

# Fee-Calculation

KoinParkSwap V3 charges a fee on each swap, which is set by the liquidity provider when creating the liquidity position. The fee is distributed to the liquidity providers based on their proportional share of the liquidity in the pool.

# Oracle-and-Price-Calculation

KoinParkSwap V3 utilizes oracles to determine the current market prices for tokens. It includes a pricing mechanism that considers the liquidity ranges and reserve balances to calculate the exchange rate for swaps within specific price intervals.

# Contract-Interactions

Users and developers can interact with the KoinParkSwap V3 smart contract through Park Chain wallets, DApps, or custom applications. They can access functions and events provided by the contract to perform actions like querying liquidity details, executing swaps, and retrieving historical data.

# Conclusion

Please note that this is a simplified overview of the KoinParkSwap V3 smart contract flow. The actual implementation and functionalities may involve additional complexities and features specific to KoinParkSwap V3. It is recommended to refer to the official KoinParkSwap V3 documentation and contract code for more detailed information and specific implementation details.
